Algorithm Design
================

One of my favorite courses from undergraduate computer science was
introductory algorithm analysis.

I believe this was in part due to the main book for the course:
Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos. The book takes on
a very mathematical approach to exposition. This made it easier for
students to be language agnostic in their analysis and design of 
algorithms. Being mathematically inclined, I enjoyed the style. 
However, I also think implementing algorithms in a machine executable
format is a key component of any pragmatic effort to learn algorithms.

This repository is an ongoing project to implement algorithms from
Kleinberg and Tardos. Some are chosen from examples in the chapter,
and others come from exercises at the end of the chapter.
